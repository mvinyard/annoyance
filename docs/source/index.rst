Documentation
********************
``annoyance`` is a wrapper of Spotify's `Annoy` library for fast kNN 
graphs. I, `Michael Vinyard <https://www.michaelvinyard.com>` am in no way 
affiliated with Spotify and this library is intended for use in my 
research with single-cell (and related) biolgical data.

I'm currently working on my PhD at Harvard University where I am developing methods for the analysis of single-cell genomics data. I also work on methods for CRISPR-Cas9-based genome-editing tools (like base-editing) to study cancer progression. My PhD work is funded by an NIH F31 award through the NCI and focuses on applying innovations in deep learning to analogous problems in the analysis of single-cell data.
